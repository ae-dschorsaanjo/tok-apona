# tok' apona
A dialect of toki pona from _jan Sotan_.

# What is it and what is it for?
This dialect is an extended version of the _de facto_ official "pu" dialect, hence it is __100% backward compatible__ with that (i.e. every pu sentence is a "valid tok' apona" sentence).

The description of the dialect is like a bunch of rules, that is because it actually is a ruleset, rather than a lesson. If you read this I assume you are _at least familiar with pu_. Anyway, please keep it in your mind that these "rules" does not meant to be followed or official, but for making the language _easier to use in speech_ and for being _able to create more complex senteces_.

Most of the things you will find here are ways of contractions, word combinations and unusual uses of words (and a kind of new grammatical structure). But still, these are only recommendations.
