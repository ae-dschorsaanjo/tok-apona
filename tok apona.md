# tok' apona
A dialect of toki pona from _jan Sotan_.

Its spelling requires the apostrophe after "tok". Please use it if possible.

# What is it and what is it for?
This dialect is an extended version of the _de facto_ official "pu" dialect, hence it is __100% backward compatible__ with that (i.e. every pu sentence is a "valid tok' apona" sentence).

The description of the dialect is like a bunch of rules, that is because it actually is a ruleset, rather than a lesson. If you read this I assume you are _at least familiar with pu_. Anyway, please keep in mind that these "rules" are not meant to be followed or official, but to make the language _easier to use in speech_ and for being _able to create more complex sentences_.

Most of the things you will find here are ways of contractions, word combinations and unusual uses of words (and a kind of new grammatical structure). But still, these are only recommendations.

# Contractions
Here you can find the ways of contractions under categories, such as long (4+ letters long) words and pronouns. In most cases, the place of elision is marked by an apostrophe.

## 3+ letters words
Any word's last vowel can be elided if the next word's first letter is the same vowel as the elidable vowel (and is not followed by _ala_). This is always marked by an apostrophe!

For example, _mi toki kepeken tok' Inli_.

## Long (4+) words
If a long word is unambiguously obvious by its first 3 (or more) letter, the elision of the further part is allowed.
For example, _toki -> tok'_.

When we shorten a word, we ought to take care that the shortened word will not be ambiguous in any way (for example, _sinpin -/-> sinp' or sinpi'_, _alasa_ -/-> _ala_ or _alas_).

## Pronouns
The pronouns (_mi_, _sina_ and _ona_) can be shortened.

### Pronoun as personal suffix
__mi__ and __sina__ can act like suffix of a verb as _'-mi'_ and _'-na'_. In this case, the noun is elided.

For example, _mi wile -> wilemi_, _sina kama sona -> kamana sona_.

### After "pi"
When there's only __sina__ after "pi", it can be shortened to _'na_.

For example, _soweli pi sina -> soweli pi 'na_ (your pet).

### Before "li", "pi li" and "pli"
__ona__ can shorten to _o'_ before "li", "pi li" and "pli".

For example, _ona li musi -> o' li musi_, _ona pi li jo e ijo li... -> o' pi li jo e ijo_ (he, who has something, ...).

### Wishes, desires
When we want to express a _wish or desire_ (for example, _jan o, pona!_), we use "o" instead of "li".
In this case, we can shorten __mi__ and __sina__ as a suffix of the verb. Important, that it will not make the sentence imperative, because we still have a subject!

For example, _sina o, lape pona! -> o, lapena pona!_ (sleep well)

## ala
__ala__ can be used as a _prefix of the negative word_ in these cases:

1. ala is used in X ala X type of question,
2. A noun has only one negative modifier (adjective or adverb -- in this case the _pi_ is elide, for example, _toki pi pona ala -> tok' apona_),
3. We negate a preposition or the noun after it.

This type of contraction is unmarked!

## li
__li__ can be contracted to the verb after it, if it's first letter is a vowel. The contraction is marked by an apostrophe.
For example, _jan ala li olin -> jan ala l'olin_.

## pi li
The __pi li__ structure (will be explained below) can be contracted to _pli_.
For example, _jan pi li musi... -> jan pli musi..._.

## X ni
In __X ni__ structures (where X can be a _preposition_ or the _e_ particle), the _ni_ can be elided, and without ending the sentence, the text (i.e. the next sentence) continues.

For example, _mi sona e ni: monsuta li lon ala -> mi sona e monsuta li lon ala_.

## Assimilations
Between

1. a preposition and the following noun, __or__
2. a verb, and the subject as a suffix,

the preposition of the verb's terminal letter (if it is an _'n'_) can be assimilated to the following word's first letter (if it is an _'n'_ or an _'m'_). These words are also being contracted without apostrophe.

For example, _tan mi -> tammi_, _lon ma pona -> lomma pona_.

## Examples
1. wile ala -> awile (unwanted),
2. wile ala wile -> wile awile (do you want...),
3. toki pi pona ala -> toki apona (not a nice language),
4. tawa ala mi -> atawa mi, taw' ala mi (not for me),
5. tawa mi ala -> tawa ami (not for *me* -- emphasis on "me", not recommended),

6. mi wile pali e nasin sin pi toki pona.
	-> wilemi pali e nasin sin pi toki pona,
7. sina wile ala wile pali e moku tawa mi?
	-> sina wile awile pali e moku tawa mi? OR wilena awile ...

# Usage of pi
The usual usage of __pi__ is the same as in the _pu_, but if we use _pi_ to express possession (i.e. it's almost identical to English's "of"), its usage is _highly recommended_, regardless of the number of words.
At any time, the possessor should be the last modifier (adj. or adv.) after the noun.

For example, _"soweli jan" can be either "humanoid animal" or "a man's animal", but "soweli pi jan" is definitely "a man's animal"_.

## pi li structure
The __pi li__ structure is for  _relative pronouns_ that are quite hard to express in toki pona. Syntactically, it acts like _li_ (subject pi li verb e object), but it does not stand alone as a sentence, rather it extends the subject or the object.

If the main sentence does not have a _li_, then add a "li" to the main sentence to mark it!
For example: _mi pi li jo e moku __li__ moku_ (I, who has some food, am eating).

## Examples
1. jan lawa mi (my boss) -> jan lawa pi mi,
2. jan pali pi tomo sina -> jan pi li pali e tomo pi 'na,
3. jan li tawa ma weka. jan ni li jo e soweli -> jan pli jo e soweli li tawa ma weka,
4. mi olin e meli. meli ni li pona tawa mi -> mi olin e meli pi li pona tawa mi.

# Prepositions
In addition of _traditional prepositions_ (tan, lon, tawa, kepeken, sama), the words of relative positions (sewi, poka, anpa, monsi, sinpin) can also act like prepositions. Using a comma before them is _highly recommended_ in these cases!

Using prepositions with an _e_ after them is _still wrong!_

## lon
Using __lon__ for timing (that would be traditionally expressed with _la_) is allowed, but the traditional way is still the preferred one.

# Conjunctions
In addition of _taso_, __en__ and __anu__ are also allowed to act like conjunctions.

# Words

## The duplicated words
There are 4 pair of words that have the same  meaning in "pu". With the exception of __ale/ali__ (they mean the same thing), I'd like to _recommend_ these little distinctions between them:

- __oko/lukin__ -- _oko only for eye_ and _lukin for any other meaning_
- __sin/namako__ -- _sin for new, fresh_ and _namako for extra, additional_
- __a/kin__ -- here the line is not well defined, I would say _a for emotional emphasis_ and _kin for confirmation_

## Unhandled words
Lacking of better term, the _unhandled words_ are those words that either:
- are not official, or
- were official or planned in the past, or
- were replaced for some reason.

Some of them are still in use, for example _kipisi_, _monsuta_ or _apeja_.

These words are allowed and welcomed to use, with the following _recommended meanings_ (the list may be deficient or inaccurate; if you have any suggestion, please write an email to me -- see the address on [my profile](https://github.com/ae-dschorsaanjo)):

- __apeja__ -- _verb_ verbal attack, disgrace -- _adj_ shame, dishonor, depressive
- __iki__ -- (replaced, old version of 'ona')
- __kan__ -- (replaced, old version of 'poka') _preposition_ among, with, near by
- __kapa__ -- (replaced, old version of 'nena')
- __kapesi__ -- _adj_ brown, gray (covered by 'pimeja')
- __kipisi__ -- _verb_ cut, splid (covered by 'tu')
- __kijetasantakalu__ -- _noun_ joke, blah-blah (originally an April Fools' Day joke with meanings 'pangolin, kinkjou, any Procyonidae, or armadillo')
- __leko__ -- _noun_ stair, square, edge; opposite of 'sike' (was used, get deprecated)
- __majuna__ -- old (from Esperanto's 'maljuna' -- afaik, was only planned)
- __monsuta__ -- _verb_ afraid of -- _noun_ monster, fear, terror (get deprecated, still widely used)
- __pake__ -- _verb_ block, obstruct (afaik was only planned)
- __pasi/pasila__ -- _adj_ good, easy (replaced, old version of 'pona')
- __pata__ -- _noun_ sibling (get deprecated, old version of 'jan sama')
- __po__ -- _adj_ _number_ four (get deprecated)
- __powe__ -- _adj_ false, untrue, trick, pretended (get deprecated, old version of 'pona ala'; my favorite "unhandled" word)
- __tuli__ _adj_ _number_ three (get deprecated)

## Additional word(s)
I would recommend these words, because there are cases when the "pu" way is not enough, ambiguous or simply "weird to say".

- __ke/oke__ -- basically interchangeable, but I recommend _ke for general yes_ and _oke for approval_ (like English's "okay", "great", "fine")

In toki pona, there is a kind of a funny way to say _yes_, and to approve something, you can only say _pona_, which can have an ambiguous meaning.

## Stress
_As in pu,_ stress is on the first syllable of a word, except the case when the _ala shorten to a-_ and became a prefix. In this case, the stress is on the _second syllable_.

## Alien words
Alien words are the _proper names_ and the _barely translatable words_ (such as "Internet").
If the meaning of this words is obvious (via context), _in the object_ you can use it also as a noun, not only like an adjective.

## Examples
0. musi ni li jo e nimi. ona li Poke.
1. nimi mi li Sotan.
2. mi kepeken ilo sona, la mi ken toki, kepeken jan, lon ilo Intene.

BUT

3. ~~Sotan li sona e ijo mute.~~
4. ~~Intene li pona tawa mi.~~
